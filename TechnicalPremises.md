Technical Premises

* The `includes/config.php` file is automatically generated by `install.php` using a template that includes:
  - Timezone configuration
  - Versioning (`version.php`)
  - Centralized Monolog logger (`logger_config.php`)
  - Session initialization
  - Database constants (`DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_CHARSET`)
  - Environment constants (`APP_ENV`, `APP_URL`)
* The code should not be modified directly on the server, but rather in the working directory. Synchronization is done through the ./deploy-putty.sh script.
* The log should be recorded to a file during application execution in the server directory itself. In this case, /var/www/capivaralearn/logs/
* Server access: plink -batch -i Nextcloud/Documents/ppk/capivaralearn.ppk root@198.23.132.15
* Production database requires password authentication (different from local development)
* Database configurations are read from includes/environment.ini file
* Production server uses Nginx with PHP-FPM (not Apache)
* HTTPS enabled with Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for capivaralearn.com.br
* Automatic SSL certificate renewal configured via Certbot

The database is located at:
DatabaseSchema.md

The logging framework is monolog.
The DB framework is medoo.
